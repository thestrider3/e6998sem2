This is the solution of Assignment 1 of Coms6998- Story Telling with Streaming Data

Part a:
I have used the Twitter Streaming API as my data Source. The Twitter Streaming API offers samples of the public data flowing through Twitter. Once the applications establish a connection to a streaming endpoint, they are delivered a feed of Tweets, without needing to worry about polling or REST API rate limits.
Each tweet provided by the streaming API has information such as the Tweet_id, Twitter User Name, Twitter text, the GeoLocation coordinates from where the tweets where posted, Creation time, Number of retweets and many such relevant information.
More details: https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/tweets
In very rare cases, the Streaming API may elect to deliver an incomplete Tweet field instead of waiting for data which is taking a long time to fetch. In the case of a numeric count, this will manifest as a -1 value. 
As I am filtering the tweets such that only tweets with username and twitter text are taken and also, selecting tweets belonging to anywhere in the world, the rate at which I am getting tweets is almost 8 tweets per second.

Part b:
I am consuming all the tweets which have text and username and delivering it to socket.io websocket server to display the tweets obtained from Twitter Streaming API onto the web browser. I am using NodeJS for doing all the above work.


To run the application:
Write your twitter access keys in index.js
Do npm install to install all the dependencies mentioned in package.json
Run node index.js
